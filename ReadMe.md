For this assignment, I was able to use Javascript to create a random password generator that outputs a password based on user input. Upon opening the site, the user is prompted with questions about what they want included in their password (lower case letter, special character, etc.). 

User responses to the aformentioned prompts are saved to the console log and subsequently the app generates a password with whatever characters they have designated to include. I was able to complete this assignment by pilling from a plethora of JS concepts that we have learned over the last week. The magic for the actual generation of password comes from a "for" loop that runs based on how many characters the user wants to include in their password.
